## 🎯 Goals

Build a robust version of:

```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
````

That will:

* ✅ Read and return **one line at a time**
* ✅ Work with **any valid file descriptor**
* ✅ Handle **multiple FDs** (bonus)
* ✅ Use dynamic memory — no fixed-size line limits
* ✅ Preserve remaining buffer data between calls

---

## 📚 Core Concepts & Skills

### 🔧 File Descriptors & Low-Level I/O

* Work with `open`, `read`, `close`
* Understand `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`
* 🔗 [GeeksforGeeks - File Descriptors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/input-output-system-calls-c-create-open-close-read-write/)

### 🧵 Buffers & Persistent State

* Use a static buffer (stash) per FD to track leftover data
* Handle partial reads and newline detection

### 🧠 Dynamic Memory

* Use `malloc`, `free`, `strjoin`, `strdup` correctly
* Clean up to avoid memory leaks

### 🧰 String Utilities

Recreate or reuse:

* `strchr` → Find `\n`
* `strdup` → Duplicate memory
* `strjoin`, `substr` → Combine & extract string parts

## ⚙️ Project Flow (How it works)

```c
get_next_line(fd)
    ↓
[Read BUFFER_SIZE bytes]
    ↓
[Append to stash]
    ↓
[Search for newline '\n']
    ↓
[Extract line + update stash]
    ↓
Return line
```

| Step              | Description                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ✅ Validate input  | Check for valid fd and buffer size |
| 📥 Read from fd   | Until newline or EOF               |
| 💾 Save remainder | Static stash retains leftover data |
| 🧻 Extract line   | Up to and including `\n`           |
| 🔚 Handle EOF     | Return `NULL` when done            |

---

## 🔧 Helper Functions

| Function          | Purpose                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `ft_strchr`       | Locate `\n` in stash                  |
| `ft_strdup`       | Duplicate a string                    |
| `ft_strjoin_free` | Join stash and buffer, free old stash |
| `ft_substr`       | Extract a substring                   |

---

## 🧪 Example Execution

Input file:

```
Hello\nWorld\n42\n
```

| Call # | Returned Line | Stash After Call |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 1      | `Hello\n`     | `World\n42\n`    |
| 2      | `World\n`     | `42\n`           |
| 3      | `42\n`        | \`\` (empty)     |
| 4      | `NULL`        | EOF reached      |

---

## 🔄 Memory & Flowchart

```
[read(fd) → BUFFER] → [append to stash]
       ↓
[find newline] → [split stash]
       ↓
[return line] + [keep leftover in static stash]
```

> Tip: Use `valgrind` or `leaks` to verify no memory is left unfreed!

---

## 🔍 Bonus: Multiple FDs

```c
int fd1 = open("file1.txt", O_RDONLY);
int fd2 = open("file2.txt", O_RDONLY);

get_next_line(fd1); // reads from file1
get_next_line(fd2); // independently reads from file2
```

Your implementation must track separate stash buffers for each FD.
Use something like a static array indexed by FD, or a custom linked list (if you're daring!).

## ✅ Checklist

* [x] Reads 1 line at a time (with `\n`)
* [x] Handles files of any size
* [x] Supports multiple FDs (bonus)
* [x] Uses only allowed functions
* [x] No memory leaks
* [x] Makefile with all required rules
* [x] Clean, modular code (helpers, no spaghetti!)

## 💬 Final Thoughts

`get_next_line` taught me how to:

* Think like the OS (I/O is tricky!)
* Work with static memory across function calls
* Build resilient and reusable logic in C
* Handle edge cases and memory carefully

> Master this project, and buffer logic will never scare you again 😤
